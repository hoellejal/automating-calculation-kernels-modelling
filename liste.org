* Tasks
** TODO Solve the strange plot issue, ask Arnaud if necessary
   When making a plot of a stan sampling, the result is surprising and
   unwelcome, we'd like to see a gaussian plot

** TODO Try with more difficult models: with noise depending on x, with a polynomial coefficient, with heterogeneity...
   - For now we have y = coefficient * x + intercept +
     rnorm(N,sd=sigma). For the first, the noise model has to be changed
   - For the second, it'd be better to have a model much like dgemm
     where y depends on a combinaison of M*N*K and M*N, M*K, N*K
   - For the third, we need to have several coefficients and intercepts
     (and perhaps noise, probably will do later in a 4th experiment)
